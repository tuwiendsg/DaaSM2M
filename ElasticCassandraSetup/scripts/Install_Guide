1. install Oracle JRE to run Cassandra  
   - example for downloading a x64 JDK from command line:  wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: gpw_e24=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com" "http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/7/jdk-7-linux-x64.tar.gz" 
    - or JRE : wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: gpw_e24=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com" "http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/7u51-b13/jre-7u51-linux-x64.tar.gz"

2. copy tar gz and untar: tar -xzf ./ElasticCassandraSetup-1.0.tar.gz
3. cd ./ElasticCassandraSetup-1.0
4. edit ./Config and set JAVA_HOME, and Cassandra properties, to static values, or values obtained from contextualization if needed or other sources. If contextualization is used, make sure you remember the key values you entered.  If Setup as Seed, the SEED property does not need to be entered?
5. run ./install.sh
   Select 1 at promt if setting up machine as Seed or as Node. There can be more than 1 seed. In this case the SEED IPs are separated by comma (",") in config.
   Now machine is set UP. If setup up as NODE, snapshot BEFORE restarting the machine. In this way you can add new NODE snapshots which will enter in the cassandra cluster.
